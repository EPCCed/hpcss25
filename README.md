# EPCC HPC Summer School 2025

This page contains key dates and information for the EPCC HPC Summer
School 2025 from Saturday June 14th to Saturday June 28th.

For the HPC Summer School we're using material from a range of
existing courses so this is also a central page to help collect them all
together.

## Schedule

### Arrival

There will be a "get-together" meal (food and soft drinks provided) at
**7pm on Saturday 14th** at [Pizza Posto](https://pizzaposto.co.uk/):
16 Nicolson St, Edinburgh, EH8 9DH. This is less than 10 minutes' walk
from the flats in Darroch Court.

### Lectures

The standard day will run from 09.30 to 17:00 with an hour for lunch
around 12:30 and coffee breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon.

However, for the first day **Monday 16th** could you please arrive at
the Bayes Building, 47 Potterrow, Edinburgh EH8 9BT, **at 09:00** to
give us more time for introductions, admin tasks etc.

Lectures will take place in Bayes or Room 2.14 in the **Lister Learning
and Teaching Centre**, 5 Roxburgh Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9SU (this is about 5
minutes from Darroch Court).

Here is the schedule: in practical sessions students will work on
their own on exercises based on the lecture material, with an EPCC
staff member on hand to help.
